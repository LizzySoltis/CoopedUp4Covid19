# Cooped up for Covid-19?

#### We are collecting resources to help break up the days and weeks ahead for both adults and kids.

#### Current Lists:

[Mostly for Adults](adults.md)

[Mostly for Kids](kids.md)

_(There are so many items that can be enjoyed by both, those tend to get added to the kid list)_

#### How you can contribute:

Pull requests are welcome.  If that is a foreign sentence to you, [create an issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) in this repo, and someone else will help add your items to this growing list.
